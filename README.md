# wpsum
A Python script that generates a file containing the checksum of every file of a Wordpress installation (excluding the wp-content directory). You can also compare this file with another list of checksums, checking the integrity of your installation.

What I want to do to finish this project:
- Get the Wordpress version;
- Create a repository with a checksum list of different Wordpress versions;
- Automatically create the file contaning the checksum of the local WP and compare it with the remote JSON;
